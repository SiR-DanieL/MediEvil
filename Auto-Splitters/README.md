# MediSplit - MediEvil Auto Splitter and Auto Starter for Live Split

MediSplit has been written for ePSXe 2.0.0 and was only tested on this emulator. It can split, start, and reset the timer automatically.
Due to the usage of `emu-help-v2`, it might also work on Duckstation and other emulators, but it was not tested with it.

## Using this Auto Splitter

1. Download the `emu-help-v2` library from this repository and paste the file into your `LiveSplit/Componets/` folder in your computer.
2. Add the *Scriptable Auto Splitter* component to your Layout on LiveSplit and, in its settings, select the ASL file you want to use. Right-click on LiveSplit and choose "Edit Layout..." to open the Layout Editor, then click on the Plus-sign and choose "Scriptable Auto Splitter" from the section "Control". You can set the Path of the Script by going into the component settings of the Scriptable Auto Splitter. To get to the settings of the component, you can either double-click it in the Layout Editor or go into the Scriptable Auto Splitter Tab of the Layout Settings. Once you've set the Path, the script should automatically load and hopefully work. Make sure you select what levels you play in order for the splitter to work properly, as well as selecting any optional bosses or glitches/skips/routes that you want to split separately.
